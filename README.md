OTM is a platform for simulating vehicular traffic scenarios. It offers multiple models that can be arbitrarily combined in a single simulation. You can also use OTM to test your own modeling concepts by using its model plugin framework. You can similarly test new controllers this way. OTM is built for research: there are APIs for Java, Python, and Matlab.
